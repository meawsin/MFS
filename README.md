# MFS
MFS (Mobile Financial System) is a simple Java-based command-line application that simulates a mobile financial service. This system allows users to manage their accounts, deposit and withdraw money, transfer funds between users, view mini-statements, and more. The data is stored and retrieved using text files to mimic a basic database system.
